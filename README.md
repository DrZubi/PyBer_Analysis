# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 Challenge
### Submission made by: Omar Zu'bi


## Overview
The goal of this report is to create a summary data frame of the ride-sharing data and to visually represent the data using a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This final written report highlights how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 

## Results
From the multi-line graph created using the merged data frames showing the total weekly fares for each type of city, the following can be inferred about the data:
* Rural Cities have the highest average fare per ride ($34.62). There are a less supply of drivers in the rural areas than bigger cities and the average fare per driver is almost three times higher for each ride ($55.49)
* Urban Cities have the lowest  average fare per ride ($24.53). Urban centers have the highest supply of drivers with the lowest average fare per driver ($16.57)

## Summary
The following recommendations are summarized after the completion of the analysis for each city type: 
1) Maintain low fares in urban cities. The city is full of drivers and the market is overly saturated. Maintaining low ride fares for urban centers will increase the number of rides per driver over their competitors. 
2) Increase the number of drivers for rural locations by working with local drivers. By offering a cheaper alternative to customers in the city, riders would preferably choose PyBer over the competitors. More allocation of resources to rural cities is not recommended. 
3) Greatest growth opportunity are in the suburbs. Increase the number of drivers to increase PyBer market share.
